### Source Code

Yet another winsock article. I made this article after downloading a portscanner on PSC.<BR>
It said something about scanning 100 ports in few seconds. Anyway it wasn't very good, it just opened a new socket for every port so if you wanted to scan a lot of ports, you needed to load many sockets, and it took a great deal of resources. anyway:<BR><BR>
This will teach you how to select the amount of sockets you want to open, and then scan ports. Just a basic portscanner, nothing special works but with no features.<BR><BR>
Remeber to download the zip if you want the project to be in with the aricle.<BR>
In the compressed there is 3 folders.<BR>
article: The article<BR>
simple: The simple portscanner we make in the article<BR>
scanner: A better portscanner, not that the scanning code is, but better look and some other features.<BR><BR>
